# Virtual Zoo

This project imagines a **virtual zoo** using Python fundamentals such as **classes, loops, lists, tuples, and dictionaries**. It served as a *refresher* of core Python concepts, including  Oriented Programming  and CSV processing. I while also imporved my familiarity with the `pandas` and learnt about the `datetime` modules.


## Features

- Animal Class - Used to store attributes on species, name & age
- Zoo Class - Managed virtual animals. Created methods that:
  1. Allowed animals to be added
  2. Returned all animals in the zoo
  3. Allowed for opening hours to be assigned
  4. Returned the total number of animals

- Function that read CSV data to obtain new animals for the zoo
- Visitor Info Functions including:
  1. Allowing visitors to know if the zoo is open or closed
  2. Total number of animals
  3. No. of animals per species
  4. Age of the oldest animals
  5. Combined age of all the animals

- Ability to see 3 random animals at one time
- Ability to allow visitors to add their own animals to thier virtual zoos


## Lessons Learned

- Improved debugging and iteration through errors
- Learned how the datetime module works through using
- Refreshed memory on importance of class design
